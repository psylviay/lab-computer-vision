    "The mean filter is simple, fast and effective for basic noise reduction. It is used when computational efficiency is important, but the edge details are not. Example: removing salt and pepper noise in a grayscale image.\n",

    "The Gaussian filter provides better noise reduction and less distortion to edges and small details, thus it is preferred when edge preservation or higher quality results are required. Examples: preprocessing for edge detection, object segmentation.\n"
